ha-cluster-pacemaker
=========

Role for configuring basic pacemaker cluster on CentOS/RHEL 6/7 systems.

Requirements
------------

RHEL: It is expected that machines will already be registered and subscribed for access to 'High Availability' or 'Resilient storage' channels.

Role Variables
--------------

  - user used for authorizing cluster nodes

    ```
    cluster_user: hacluster
    ```

    ```
    cluster_user_pass: testtest
    ```

  - group to which cluster user belongs (should be 'haclient')

    ```
    cluster_group: haclient
    ```

  - name of the cluster

    ```
    cluster_name: pacemaker
    ```

  - configuration of firewall for clustering, NOTE in RHEL/Centos 6 this replaces iptables configuration file!
  
    ```
    cluster_firewall: true
    ```

  - enable cluster on boot
  
    ```
    cluster_enable_service: true
    ```

  - configure cluster with fence_xvm fencing device ?
    This will copy /etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key to nodes and add fencing devices to cluster
    NOTE: you need to define 'vm_name' in the inventory for each cluster node
  
    ```
    cluster_configure_fence_xvm: true
    ```

  - configure cluster with fence_kdump fencing device ?
    This starts kdump service and defines the fence_kdump stonith devices.
    NOTE: if the kdump service is not started this won't work properly or at all
  
    ```
    cluster_configure_fence_kdump: false
    ```

  - (RHEL only) enable the repositories containint packages needed
    ```
    enable_repos: true
    ```

  - (RHEL only) enable the extended update (EUS) repositories containint packages needed
    ```
    enable_eus_repos: false
    ```

  - (RHEL only) enable the SAP Solutions update service (E4S) repositories containint packages needed
    ```
    enable_e4s_repos: false
    ```

  - (RHEL only) enable Beta repositories containint packages needed
    ```
    enable_beta_repos: false
    ```

  - (RHEL only) type of enable repositories
    - ha - High-Availability
    - rs - Resilient Storage
    ```
    repos_type: 'ha'
    ```

  - (CentOS only) install the needed packages from the CD-ROM media available at /dev/cdrom
    ```
    use_local_media: false
    ```

  - Enable or disable PCSD web GUI. By default the role keeps the default of installation means that
    PCSD web GUI is disabled on CentOS/RHEL 6.X and enabled on CentOS/RHEL 7.X. `true` or `false` can
    be passed to this variable to make sure that PCSD web GUI is enabled or disabled.
    ```
    enable_pcsd_gui: 'nochange'
    ```

  - Cluster transport protocol. By default this role will use what is default for give OS.
    For CentOS/RHEL 6.X this means 'udp' (UDP multicast) and for CentOS/RHEL 7.X this means 'udpu'
    (UDP unicast). This variable accepts following options: `default`, `udp` and `udpu`.
    ```
    cluster_transport: 'default'
    ```

Example Playbook
----------------

Example playbook for creating cluster named 'test1' enabled on boot, with fence_xvm and firewall settings

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: OndrejHome.ha-cluster-pacemaker, cluster_name: 'test1' }

Example for creating cluster named 'test2' without configuring firewalling and without fence_xvm.
For cluster to get properly authorize it is expected that firewall is already configured or disabled.

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: OndrejHome.ha-cluster-pacemaker, cluster_name: 'test2', cluster_firewall: false, cluster_configure_fence_xvm: false }

WARNING: this is alpha-version quality proof-of concept role that still needs some polishing and is using custom modules 
         to interact with pacemaker through python. This is suitable for testing purposes only.
